# Task

My personal task management system for taking notes and being productive.

## Tools

- [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/)
- [Taskwarrior TUI: Rust based](https://kdheepak.com/taskwarrior-tui/#installation)
- [Vim Wiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki)
- [Timewarrior](https://timewarrior.net/docs/)


## Tips

Everything that comes in gets a priority from 1 to 3 and a timestamp. It also gets a status - in progress, open or finished - with further info on where the loop is stuck right then, mainly when I am waiting for information from a third party.
